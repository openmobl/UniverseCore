/* For each character, _Ctype[] contains an ORed-together set of the
   following flags and, in the 0x01 and 0x02 bits (which we'll call O),
   an index into a table of differences used for case conversion.  */

#define L 0x04	/* Lowercase letter	a-z, accented lowercase letters */
#define U 0x08	/* Uppercase letter	A-Z, accented uppercase letters */
#define D 0x10	/* Hexadecimal digit	0-9 A-F a-f */
#define P 0x20	/* Printable character	anything with a non-stupid glyph */
#define S 0x40	/* Horizontal w.space	SP \t NBSP NUMSP */
#define C 0x80	/* Control-char w.space	\t \n \v \f \r */

/* This compact encoding depends on several properties of the Palm OS
   character set:

   * It happens to have some uncased letters (the feminine and masculine
     ordinal indicators) but no both-cased letters.  So we will consider
     having both L and U set to mean an uncased letter (oddly enough).

   * It has very few interesting "control characters".  In fact the only
     characters that are really control characters are the (non-printing)
     whitespace characters.  This allows us to merge the two concepts
     (control char; most whitespace) into one flag, C.

   * We've cheated with isgraph().  The Standard says that isgraph() is
     the same as isprint() except for ' '.  In particular, isgraph(NBSP)
     is supposed to be true, even though NBSP, like SP, has no visible
     glyph.  Somewhat more logically, the convention on Palm OS seems
     to be for isgraph() to measure whether a printable character has
     a visible glyph, and we've implemented it so that it differs from
     isprint() for all space-like characters: SP, NBSP, and NUMSP.

   * Pairs of corresponding upper- and lowercase letters differ by only
     three different amounts:  most are like the familiar 'a' - 'A' = 32,
     and only two other differences appear.  These four possibilities
     (three real offsets, and an offset of 0 for all the non-letters
     that are left unchanged by tolower/toupper) can be encoded in the
     remaining two bits, O.

   Given the flag definitions above and these pieces of luck, we can
   implement all the classification functions:

	isalnum = L|U|D			islower = L but not U
	isalpha = L|U			isupper = U but not L
	isdigit = D but not L|U		isxdigit= D

	isblank = S			isprint = P
	isspace = S|C			iscntrl = C

	isgraph = P but not S
	ispunct = P but not L|U|D|S = P but not L|U|D|S|C|O

   The index within OFFSETS of the appropriate difference for each character
   affected by tolower() or toupper() is stored in O.  Most characters are
   unaffected by these functions, so have O = 0 (since OFFSETS[0] = 0).

   The only characters affected by tolower() are uppercase letters; in
   particular, they do not have their L flag set.  Thus if we mask off all
   bits but O|L, we will get an index in the range {0--7}.  For lowercase
   (and uncased) letters which should not be affected, the index will be
   {4--7}; for others, the index will be the correct index into OFFSETS.

   Similarly, for toupper(), by masking off all bits but O|U we get an index
   in the range {0--3, 8--11}.  For uppercase (and uncased) letters, the index
   will be {8--11}; for others, it will be the correct index into OFFSETS.

   Thus an array with _Cconv[0--3] = OFFSETS and _Cconv[4--11] = 0 provides
   the differences (usually 0!) needed to add to or subtract from each
   character so that we can implement the case conversion functions:

	tolower difference = _Cconv[O|L]
	toupper difference = _Cconv[O|U]

   See the (somewhat obfuscated) definitions in <ctype.h> to see how all this
   translates into code.  */
